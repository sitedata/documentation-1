## Re-send email invitations

If someone indicates that they didn't receive an invitation email, the first thing to do is for them to search for the keywords "Invitation to join" in the target inbox, including in the spam folder.  
  
If they still can't find them, the easiest way to re-trigger the emails is:

1. Go to the settings page of the Collective &gt; Core contributors section
2. Remove the concerned users
3. Click on Save
4. ​Click on "Add core contributor" and add them again \(you should be able to search by pasting user emails in the search box\)
