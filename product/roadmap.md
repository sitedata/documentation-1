# Roadmap

[View our Roadmap updates on our blog](https://blog.opencollective.com/tag/roadmap/)

## **Key questions for prioritization**

**This is what we ask ourselves to decide what gets done and what doesn't.**

* Does this serve our mission
* Will this help to make us financially sustainable within a year?
* Can this make us move faster?
* Does this increase quality?
* Does this add technical debt?
* Is it feasible to build and maintain with our current team and runway?
* What insight or research is this project based on?
* Is this problem already solved elsewhere?
* How will we measure our success? Do we have a baseline today that we can compare this against?
* How well do we understand the complexity of the problem, feature to be added or user need to be addressed?
* What is the estimated timeframe for delivering this project?

## Template for new projects

* Github issue
  * explain the feature. 
  * Link to other opened issues or data. 
  * Include details below.
* Kickoff
  * Organize a special meeting or on a scheduled one. 
* Project owner. 
  * Role: Facilitator, decision-maker, producer. 
  * It's ultimately responsible for \(needs to do or organize who does\)
    * Delivery 
    * Q&A
    * Docs & Comms 
    * Post-ship plan for maintenance 
* Success metric\(s\)
* Timeframe - kickoff and delivery, main milestones / roadmap
