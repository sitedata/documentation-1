# Add Funds Manually

You can manually add funds to a Collective directly. This is useful when you receive a contribution for a Collective outside the Open Collective system \(like a bank transfer\) and want to apply it to a Collective's budget, or to represent money you're already holding on the platform.

Log in and go to your [Fiscal Host dashboard](fiscal-host-dashboard.md). Click on the **Hosted Collectives** tab.

Use the search bar to find the Collective you want to add funds for.

And fill the form with all required information to add the funds to that Collective with the following information:

* The **amount** of funds you want to send to a Collective.
* Your **host fee**, which is the fee you charge your Collectives. It's already set to your default, but you can change it to a one-time fee of your preference.
* A short **description** of those funds.
* The **source** of those funds. It can be your Fiscal Host, another Collective, or an Organization.

Once you're done, just click on **Add Funds**.
