# Connect external accounts

## Connecting a Twitter account

Click on **Connect Twitter**. You will be prompted to either directly authorize Open Collective to access your account or to log in and authorize it.

Connecting your account will provide you a few automation options based on how many financial contributors Collectives you host have reached:

### The Beta test

We're currently testing this feature with the help of selected Host collectives.

If you're interested in testing this feature, please reach out through [https://opencollective.com/support](https://opencollective.com/support). If you're already testing the feature and wish to leave the test, you can also send an email to support.

### Fees

#### What are the fees involved?

There are payment processor fees charged by PayPal and if you're subjected to, the platform fees charged by Open Collective.

The payment processor fees will be automatically deducted from the original charge but as of now, the platform fees can not be automatically deducted. For the current beta, this debt will be settled once a month through an invoice we'll send you.
